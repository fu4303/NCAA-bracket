## NCAA Bracket

HTML + CSS + NCAA bracket = Geek sports

### Rundown

A [Less](http://lesscss.org/ "http://lesscss.org/" ) file is used for style but is definitely not required. 

Just add the code below in your teams specified slot:
    <span class="seed"><!-- Add Seed # --></span> <!-- School Name --> <em class="score"><!-- Total Score --></em>

Add the `<strike>` tag for losers & `<strong>` tag for winners. Examples are provided. 2012 tournament names will be added when they are released. Cheers!
